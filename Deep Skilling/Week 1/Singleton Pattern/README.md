# SingletonPatternExample

This is a Java example of implementing the Singleton Design Pattern through a simple `Logger` utility.

## ðŸ”§ Structure

```
SingletonPatternExample/
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ com/
        â””â”€â”€ singleton/
            â”œâ”€â”€ Logger.java
            â””â”€â”€ Main.java
```

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (like IntelliJ or Eclipse).
2. Compile and run `Main.java`.
3. Observe that the same `Logger` instance is used throughout the application.

## ðŸ’¡ About Singleton

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## ðŸ“Œ Output Sample

```
Logger Initialized...
[LOG] Application started.
[LOG] Logging some debug info...
Same Logger instance is being used across the application.
```
